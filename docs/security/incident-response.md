  - Unexpected IAM role usage
  - Abnormal ECS task behavior

- **Immediate Actions**:
  1. Isolate affected resources using security groups
  2. Rotate compromised AWS credentials
  3. Enable enhanced CloudWatch logging
  4. Block suspicious IPs via WAF

- **Recovery Steps**:
  1. Review CloudTrail logs
  2. Update IAM policies
  3. Patch affected resources
  4. Run infrastructure security scans

### 2. Application Security Incidents
- **Indicators**:
  - Dependabot critical alerts
  - OWASP dependency check alerts
  - Snyk security notifications
  - SonarQube vulnerability reports
  - Abnormal application logs

- **Immediate Actions**:
  1. Deploy WAF emergency rules
  2. Scale down affected services
  3. Enable enhanced logging
  4. Block suspicious traffic patterns

- **Recovery Steps**:
  1. Update vulnerable dependencies
  2. Deploy security patches
  3. Run full security scan
  4. Update security controls

### 3. Container Security Incidents
- **Indicators**:
  - ECS task failures
  - Container escape attempts
  - Unusual container network traffic
  - Resource usage anomalies

- **Immediate Actions**:
  1. Isolate affected containers
  2. Scale down suspicious tasks
  3. Capture container logs
  4. Block container network access

## üìù Incident Response Process

### Detection Phase
1. Monitor security tools:
   - AWS GuardDuty
   - CloudWatch Alarms
   - WAF Logs
   - Security Hub
   - Dependabot Alerts

2. Alert channels:
   - Slack (#security-alerts)
   - Email notifications
   - PagerDuty escalations

### Analysis Phase
1. Assess impact:
   - Production systems affected?
   - Customer data compromised?
   - Compliance implications?

2. Classify severity:
   - Critical: Customer impact, data breach
   - High: Service disruption
   - Medium: Limited impact
   - Low: No service impact

### Containment Phase
1. Infrastructure:
   - Isolate affected resources
   - Update security groups
   - Apply WAF rules

2. Application:
   - Deploy security patches
   - Update dependencies
   - Scale services

### Recovery Phase
1. Verification:
   - Security scan results
   - Compliance checks
   - System integrity

2. Documentation:
   - Incident timeline
   - Actions taken
   - Evidence collected
